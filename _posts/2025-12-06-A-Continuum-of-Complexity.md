When I reflect on life, I see a line — an axis, or even a vector — connecting the diversity of living organisms with their complexity. The farther along this line we move, the more the form of organization changes. What begins in biology eventually extends into human societies, governments, and companies.

## The continuum of life

* At the simplest level, bacteria represent astonishing diversity. They are everywhere, adapting to nearly any environment imaginable.
* As we move toward plants and insects, diversity decreases, even though complexity increases.
* With animals, and especially mammals, the variety narrows further. Humans, despite our achievements, may be the least variable of all.

DNA is the key mechanism driving this pattern. It sets the template, guiding life along this vector from simple and diverse to complex and specialized.

## The next stage: coded societies

If DNA is the blueprint for organisms, then perhaps the next evolutionary step is **groups of humans bound by codes** — not genetic codes, but **laws, rules, and systems**. These shared codes allow groups to function like new “organisms”:

* **Companies** coordinate resources and labor to achieve goals no individual could manage.
* **Governments** establish order and defend the collective.
* **Nations** trade, compete, and sometimes wage war, just as animals hunt, cooperate, or fight for territory.

In this sense, human institutions mirror biological systems. They evolve, adapt, and sometimes collapse — much like living organisms.

## A hope for global order

Yet our “social organisms” are still immature. Just as animals kill one another, countries and corporations often act with aggression or short-term self-interest. The question is whether humanity can evolve into something greater — into global systems that create peace and stability rather than conflict.

Organizations like the European Union point in this direction. If humanity can agree on **actionable and maintainable global laws**, then perhaps we can evolve beyond our current state, forming a collective organism greater than any one nation.

## Conclusion

From bacteria to humans, and from humans to societies, life can be seen as a story of complexity replacing diversity. Each stage introduces a new “code” — DNA for organisms, laws for societies — that enables cooperation and growth. The next challenge is whether humanity can expand this code to a truly global level, allowing us to evolve beyond competition into collaboration.

### Takeaways

* **Patterns repeat across scales.** The dynamics of survival, cooperation, and conflict in biology often reappear in human societies.
* **Codes shape evolution.** Just as DNA organizes life, laws and rules may organize the next stage of human development.
